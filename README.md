**Objective**
The AI Triage System is an application that allows user to search, manage, and update patient information.

The Application will provide healthcare professionals an easy way of getting and updating patient information before and after a visit.

**Why it matters**
The application will shorten the time required to gather the necessary information to treat a patient using AI technology to summarize the patient's information and history.

The system will allow for simple record keeping and submission after a visit. The AI system record the interaction and assist with documenting the patient's visit for record keeping.

We hope to reduce the amount of time, healthcare professionals have to spend before initiating treatment and the aftercare at the end of a visit.

**Instructions**
Access to the Ai Triage System and the database associated requires healthcare credentials.

Individuals will be provided accounts that can be used to access the private secured database and AI Triage System.
